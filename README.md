This tool is still under development so maybe you want to try this out later.
But if you wish, first set up [moses](http://www.statmt.org/moses/) and build a [syntax-based](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.SyntaxTutorial) model.
After that, point the .cfg file to the working directory and the corresponding run number of your model.
Run the tool with
> python erranalysis.py -h
to see explanation of options available.
